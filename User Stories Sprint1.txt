Sprint 1

Class
1. Add
	- I can add a class to the UML Diagram from the main menu. If I add the same name, it should not be allowed, and
	  I should be reprompted. 
	
2. Delete
	- I can delete any class that I can create. I can do this by name. If the name doesnt exist, 
	  I will get reprompted. When in the process of deleting, it will explain the relations of the object being deleted. 
	
3. Rename
	- I can rename a class whenever wanted, but the name should not be changed if name is invalid or a duplicate.

Relationship
1. Add
	- I can add a relationship between classes when I inquire a source, and destination. If either
	  of theses are invalid, nothing will be changed, and I will be told to do it again. 
	  
2. Delete
	- I can delete a relationship between two classes when I give a source, and destination. If either
	  of theses are invalid, nothing will be changed, and I will be told to do it again. 


Fields
1. Add Field
	- I will be prompted to give a class, and a field name. If the class doesn't exist, the field will not be created, and the user will be prompted to try again.
	  If the name is not unique, or uses invalid characters (%$@!), the user will be prompted to try again and the field will not be created.

2. Add Method
